# RAG Assistant
Trying to build a system which accepts queries regarding a file :)

---

## Stuff to Do:
- Experiment with chunking strategies.
- Better searching, not only semantics but also keywords.
- Work with complex questions like comparisons.
- Multiple file compatibility.
- Cache the chunks into a knowledge base or vectordb.
- Add a citation system so that we know where the answer came from.
- Add support for multiple file types, OCR support.
- Offline alternatives.
- Deploy?
